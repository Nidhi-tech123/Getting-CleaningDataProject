# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. The end goal is to create a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

## Project Objectives

The R script `run_analysis.R` does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test datasets to create one dataset.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names** to name the activities in the dataset.
4. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy dataset** with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files in This Repository

1) `run_analysis.R`: The R script used to clean and process the data.
2)`tidy_data.txt`: The final tidy dataset output from the script.
3) `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, data sources, and transformations used.
